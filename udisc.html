                    <h2>Project Framing</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p class="CS-Content">I believe in constant improvement. Though UDisc is one of my favourite mobile apps and is easy to use in general, there is always room for iteration. Some of the areas I believe could use improvement include:</p>
                    <ul>
        
                        <li class="icon-list"><b>Faster scorecard creation</b></li>
                        <li class="icon-list">A greater social aspect (profiles, stats, etc)</li>
                        <li class="icon-list">More options for play style (match play, doubles, etc)</li>
                        <li class="icon-list"><b>The ability to categorize round type</b></li>
                        <li class="icon-list">A cleaner survey experience</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="CS-Content">In this article, I will quickly focus on two of these suggestions, those in bold.</p>
        
                    <h2>Faster Scorecard Creation</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p class="CS-Content">After some initial research among fellow disc golfers, it was noted that creating a scorecard takes a lot of of steps; 5 total steps to be exact.</p>
                    <p class="quote">Create Scorecard > Select Course > Select Layout > Confirm Players > Create Scorecard</p>
                    <p class="CS-Content">Obviously, the steps are not without reason. They allow the player to make sure each aspect is correct before they play. In cases when one player is keeping score for others, these steps are necessary to allow them to add other players to the card. However, there are many instances where a player <b>only wants to create a scorecard for themselves, on their regular home course.</b> These extra steps can therefore become redundant, and users must spend a fair amount of time tapping through screens before their scorecard is finally created.</p>
                    <p class="CS-Content">In order to streamline the process, I suggest a simple fix. It will be noted that when selecting a course, the nearest course is displayed at the top half of the screen, while other nearby courses take up the bottom half. My research found that in many cases <b>these other nearby courses are taking up unnecessary space</b> as the top option is usually correct.</p>
                    <p class="CS-Content">Therefore, the space has the potential to be used in a more profitable way: a place to add <b>ready-made scorecards.</b> Users would have the option to create "favourite" scorecards which they frequently use. Then, users only need to follow this progression to create their most common scorecard type:</p>
                    <p class="quote">Create Scorecard > Select Favourite > Create Scorecard</p>
                    <p class="CS-Content">This brings the overall number of steps required from 5 to 3 for the user's most frequent rounds. A simple wireframe showing how this would work can be seen below.</p>
                    <img id="solo-image" src="/Images/UDISC_Scorecard.PNG" alt="UDisc scorecard wireframe">

        
                    <h2>Round Categorization with Tags</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p class="CS-Content">This second proposal is again the result of some research among fellow disc golfers.</p>
                    <p class="CS-Content">Many disc golfers take pride in their stats. It is important to them to see improvement in their scores, percentages, etc. This type of user will make sure to track every round on UDisc to make sure the numbers are as accurate as possible.</p>
                    <p class="CS-Content">Sometimes, however, this disc golfer runs into a problem. Let's say that a girl and her friends are interested in playing a nighttime glow round. As per usual, this girl wants to keep track of her score on UDisc. However, she has a problem: <b>She is worried that her inevitably higher score will harm her goal of reaching an average of par on the year.</b> At the same time, it is important for her to be able to look back in order to see how she did.</p>
                    <p class="CS-Content">A possible solution to this girl's problem is to introduce <b>tags</b>. These would allow the user to tag their rounds with tags such as 'glow round', 'best shot doubles', 'ript revenge', 'solo', etc. Not only is this helpful when looking back to determine the mode of play, but it could also allow for an expansion of the statistics aspect of the app itself. Users could consequently see their stats organized by category, and not have to worry about one type of round (a glow round for example) affecting their more serious stats. Once again, a suggestion as to how this could look can be seen below in wireframe form.</p>
                    <img id="solo-image" src="/Images/UDISC_Tags.PNG" alt="UDisc tags wireframe">

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p class="CS-Content">Of course, the impact and feasibility of these suggested improvements would need to be tested and iterated further. However, it is hoped that these at least provide some helpful suggestions and options as to how improvement might be made!</p>
                    <p class="CS-Content">Improvement in these areas is important <b>because it is important to the user,</b> and if it is important to the user, it is important to me. As a User Experience Designer, I will strive to bring the very best of the skills I have learned, as well as a mind that is open to learning, in order to achieve my mission: advocating for the needs of disc golfers everywhere.</p>
