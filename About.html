            <p class="About-me1">Hey there! Thanks for taking a moment to look through my portfolio. My name is Sam. Sam I am. I'm a <b>User Experience Designer</b> who has just started out my incredible journey in the field of UX. I am currently a second year student at Wilfrid Laurier University, where I am majoring in UX. Among other things, I have already participated in a large variety of related courses, performed group work, and presented our solutions.</p>
            <p class="About-me">I love all aspects of design. From conducting interviews and user research, to synthesizing information; from prototyping and testing, to UI design; I love it all! It is my goal to <b>advocate for the needs of <s style="font-weight: normal;">users</s> normal people </b> - and I think that shows in my work.</p>
            <p class="About-me">When I'm not solving people's problems, I like to spend my time working on side projects (like coding this website), travelling, and studying my Bible. I am a dedicated Bible student and believer in God, and I hope that shows in the way I conduct myself in everyday life. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me and I'd be happy to chat!</p>
            <p class="About-me">I'm incredibly excited for where this field might take me next. Whatever comes my way, I'll be ready to take it on. Here's to the future!</p>
            <p class="About-me">P.S. Did I mention I coded this website myself? 😁</p>
