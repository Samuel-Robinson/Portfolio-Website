            <h2>Project Framing</h2>
            <hr>
            <p class="CS-Content">It has become fairly common knowledge that ever since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, restaurants have been hit extra hard by a lack of customers, limitations on space, and overall competition in the ever-growing food delivery sector. In an already difficult industry in which to keep a business running, it has become almost impossible to do so, and many restaurants owners have been forced to close down their shops.<p>
        
            <p class="quote">In short, restaurants are suffering — and suffering greatly.<p>

            <p class="CS-Content">Realistically however, this restaurant problem has been around far before the pandemic hit. In fact, restaurants have been facing more and more challenges in the years leading up to today: one of the largest being third-party delivery services such as Grubhub or UberEats taking absolutely massive chunks of the profits for themselves. Restaurants have facing other problems too, such as a dwindling amount of customers choosing to eat in and turning to more convenient options.<p></p>

            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <hr>
            <p class="CS-Content">The approach to this project was simple: <b>define the stakeholders, heavily research the problem space, define the needs of our users, and brainstorm a solution.</b> </p>
<p class="CS-Content">Tools used:</p>
            <ul>
        
                <li class="icon-list">Pen and Paper</li>
                <li class="icon-list">Value Proposition Canvas</li>
                <li class="icon-list">Adobe XD</li>
                <li class="icon-list"><a href="https://miro.com" target="_blank">Miro</a></li>
                <li class="icon-list">Procreate</li>
                <li class="icon-list">Adobe Illustrator</li>
                <li class="icon-list">Google Suite</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>User Research/Research Phase</h2>
            <hr>
            <p class="CS-Content">Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, we were fairly limited in the way in which we could run <b>user studies.</b> Looking back on the project, I would have preferred to have been able to run <b>user interviews</b> and <b>focus groups</b>, in order to promote further conversation and insights. Because of these restrictions,we were limited to secondary research for our information about restaurant workers in particular (owners, chefs, waitresses, etc).</p>
            <p class="CS-Content">In order to learn about the customers, we utilized open-ended interviews, in addition secondary research. We mapped out our findings using <b>lots</b> of maps, including <b>user journey maps</b>, <b>empathy maps</b>, and the <b>design proposition canvas</b>, in order to best understand the user’s needs.</p>

            <img id="solo-image" src="/Images/Maps.jpg" alt="Customer Journey maps, value proposition canvas, etc">

            <p class="CS-Content">The finding from our research was enlightening to say the least:</p>

            <p class="quote">What we discovered was <span style=color:#34cbd6>contrary</span> to our prior beliefs.</p>

            <p class="CS-Content">One thing we realized in doing the research about the customers was that <b>our initial assumptions about how people thought of the whole dining experience were entirely different to what people actually thought</b>.
                For instance, one of our group members assumed that when it came to dining out, there were two big factors that mattered: the amount of money it would cost; and the amount of time it would take.</p>
            <p class="CS-Content">But actually, when we turned to the restaurant customers, the price of the food, and the time spent weren’t even in the list of things that truly mattered. Instead, there were <b>5 key components</b> that either make or break the entire experience.</p>

            <p class="quote">Rather than much care being taken towards price, time, etc... there is an <span style=color:#34cbd6>emotional attachment</span> that fixes itself to the entire dining experience.</p>
            <p class="CS-Content">Those feelings that come with having quality conversations with family members or a friend, or being able to show other people a photo on instagram of what your meal looked like and receiving feedback and praise on how delicious it looks, or even just the whole experience of spending the day looking forward to getting off work and heading over to a restaurant -- these are the things that really matter to people, and so we made sure we pivoted our focus going forward.</p>

           <p class="CS-Content">That being said, we didn’t want to neglect restaurant owners, employees, and chefs from our research, because they also play a main role in delivering the whole experience to the customer.

           <p class="CS-Content">As can be gathered from above, there are <b>clear tensions</b> that exist between doing something for the benefit of themselves vs the restaurant. For example, chefs want to be creative with their food, but working at a restaurant requires extreme consistency. Similarily, managers or store owners might want to disrupt the established norms of a restaurant in order to be different from the competition, and yet are required to maintain the same standards.</p>
           <p class="CS-Content">Therefore, it was imperitive that whatever our solution might look like, that it <b>would help to bridge the gap between these tensions</b>. Rather than take away from one side or the other, we wanted to help both.</p>

                <p class="quote">How might we create a unique and accessible dining experience that benefits both the customer and the restaurant lond term?</p>
                <p class="CS-Content">In an effort to  take this problem and form a solution, our group placed our HMW Statement on the centre of a whiteboard on Mural, and diverged to brainstorm as many possible solutions as we could. 
                    We then placed all our ideas in an affinity map(below), grouping the related ideas and then colour coding them to be identifiable later on.
                    After this, we chose our best ideas and placed them on an impact vs feasibility chart -
                    impact being how successful it will be in meeting users’ needs, and feasibility being how cost and time effective the idea is. 
                    We wanted something that was high in both impact and feasibility.
                    As you can see on the right, the blue circle indicates the ideas with the highest on both scales. These are the ideas we took and voted on to form our final solution.

           <h2>Prototype Phase</h2>
           <hr>
           <p class="CS-Content">Feeling that we now had a solid foundation from which to base our design project, we jumped from the research phase into prototyping. We had a good idea of where we needed to go, and how we could help our end user. Based upon the opportunities and issues mentioned above, we created some initial drawings on paper, as well as some prototypes in Adobe XD, trying to maintain the items of need as expressed by our research. Incorporating the ideas of Color Perception Theory, we wanted to use green as the primary colour of our app because it represents good food, health and fresh fruits and vegetables. It also represents prosperity and wealth and so makes a good identity colour for our app. Along with that we considered yellow and red to support.</p>
           <img id=solo-image src="/Images/Sketch.png" alt="Persona" height=635 width=635>
           <img id=solo-image src="/Images/PrototypeImg.png" alt="Persona" height=635 width=635>

           <p class="CS-Content">With these initial prototypes done, we moved on to create a more coherent prototype that we would be able to test with our users. Using Adobe XD, we created a prototype with all the necessary features in order to test the usability of each one. Below are some screenshots of the prototype, displaying some of the key features, including the shopping list, fridge tracker, and navigation page. Other features included dietary settings (to promote accessibility), price checking at several different stores, and a receipt scanner to automatically add purchased list items to the fridge.</p>
           <img id=solo-image src="/Images/NicerProt.png" alt="Persona" height=635 width=635>

           <h2>User Testing</h2>
           <hr>
           <p class="CS-Content">From there we moved on to the testing phase. It was imperative that the design be easy and intuitive to use. In order to test out design, we decided to utilize usability testing, along with the think-aloud technique. By getting our users to think out loud as they performed the tasks we had assigned, we were able to gain some key insights into their initial thoughts about the app, and how it worked while navigating through it.</p>
           <p class="CS-Content">Our usability testing included 6 participants. We asked each to sit down with our app, and perform approximately 9 tasks. Each participant was given either a pass or fail for each task, and was timed.</p>
           <img id=solo-image src="/Images/UXTable.png" alt="Persona" height=800 width=800>
           <p class="CS-Content">From these tests we were able to gain a number of key insights. For instance, many of the users found <strong>the home page was fairly confusing</strong> - there was too much information to process, which led to a slow level of processing. Most also found it difficult or impossible to <strong>find the location with the cheapest price</strong>. We further noticed that there was a lot of confusion around the difference between adding an item to the list, and adding it to the cart. Not only was there far too many options visible, but the wording threw most off, leaving them to assume the item was already in their cart when in fact it wasn't.</p>
            <p class="CS-Content">On another note, several of the tasks were completed with no trouble. Users were quickly and easily able to change their dietary settings, add lemonade to the grocery list, and figure out the expiry dates in the fridge.</p>
            
            <h2>Iteration</h2>
            <hr>
            <p class="CS-Content">We took the results from these tests, and discussed how we might iterate our prototype to better suit the users needs. We left the features that worked well alone, and focused on those that needed a higher degree of usability. Below are some revised sketches, outlining the key changes to make based on user feedback.</p>
            <img id=solo-image src="/Images/Sketch.jpeg" alt="Persona" height=635 width=635>
            <img id=solo-image src="/Images/NewSketch1.png" alt="Persona" height=635 width=635>
            <img id=solo-image src="/Images/New Sketch 2.png" alt="Persona" height=635 width=635>

            <p class="CS-Content">These sketches led to a far more simplified and intuitive prototype. The most noteworthy changes were:
            <ul>
                <li class="icon-list">Removing the homepage entirely. Testing proved it was an unnecessary page that served the exact same function as the navigation bar, but with added complexity. Instead, the app opens to a simple page illustrated above that holds the user’s lists</li>
                <li class="icon-list">An overhaul of how the list works. Simple checkboxes remove the use of words and unnecessary buttons. Simply swipe to delete. Also the addition of a visual budget bar, rather than simply numbers, to make for less reading</li>
                <li class="icon-list">Removing the price match feature from the grocery list page, and adding it to the update home page - allows for quick recognition.</li>
                <li class="icon-list">Larger text and buttons all around</li>
                <li class="icon-list"> Move the recipes to the fridge page</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="CS-Content">Below are some shots from the old prototype compared to the new, to showcase the differences:</p>
                </p>
                <img id=solo-image src="/Images/Old_New1.png" alt="Differences" height=635 width=635>
                <img id=solo-image src="/Images/Old_New2.png" alt="Differences" height=635 width=635>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p class="CS-Content">The result of the testing proved that the design presented far too much information to be readily discernible - the updated prototype prioritizes simple function and operation. Though we cannot be certain our design changes work until we test with our users for a second time, we feel confident that the new prototype will do a far better job at meeting their needs, because we have done our best to incorporate the necessary changes brought up during the testing phase.</p>
