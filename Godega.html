            <h2>Project Framing</h2>
            <p class="CS-Content">Grocery shopping is an essential part of many people’s lives, and yet it is generally regarded as an unenjoyable experience; a pleasureless chore that takes up time and effort from other activities. Many companies have sought to act in response to this, and have created online shops where users can "shop for groceries" on their couch, and have them delivered right to their home. However, our research has shown that for a variety of reasons, most people still prefer to shop in store, leading us to ponder the important question:<p>
        
            <p class="quote">“How might we re-define the grocery shopping process in order to save people time and money, while ultimately turning the negative emotions associated with it into an enjoyable and pleasurable experience?”</p>

            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <p class="CS-Content">Our original idea was an app that helped alleviate the pain of grocery shopping in some way, and some quick online research (backed by personal experience) immediately confirmed that most people found grocery shopping to be a bothersome chore. We began by brainstorming possible solutions in the form of a mobile app (the project description provided required the solution be in the form of some mobile or web interface). Our initial ideas revolved around saving time, money, and effort, and before getting to deep into the consideration of ideas, we knew we needed some solid <strong>user research</strong> to go from.</p>
